SoftUni - Exercises and Projects

# Overview
SoftUni's Java Developer path is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Java programming language and its ecosystem. Through a series of lectures, projects, and exercises, I've learned about various Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, databases, web development, and more.

# Repository Structure
This repository is organised by course modules, with each module containing its own set of projects and assignments. Each project or assignment is contained in its own directory with the implementation details, and other relevant information.
