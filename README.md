## SoftUni - Exercises and Projects
This repository serves as a collection of exercises and projects completed during my journey through the Software University's Java Developer path. The path is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Java programming language and its ecosystem. Through a series of lectures, projects, and exercises, I gained knowledge in various Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, databases, web development, and more.

## Overview
The Software University's Java Developer path was a transformative experience that prepared me for a career in Java development. The path consisted of several courses, each focusing on specific areas of Java programming. Here is a brief overview of the courses and topics covered:

1. Programming Basics: This course laid the foundation for Java programming. Topics covered included variables, conditionals (if-else statements), loops (for, while, nested loops), and other fundamental concepts.

2. Java Fundamentals: Building upon the basics, this course delved deeper into Java programming. Topics covered included Git and GitHub, HTTP basics, data types and variables, arrays, methods, lists, software development concepts, regular expressions, problem-solving techniques, text processing, and more.

3. Java Advanced: This course explored advanced Java concepts and data structures. It consisted of two submodules:

    - Java Advanced: In this submodule, I gained a deeper understanding of topics such as maps, stacks, queues, sets, streams, functional programming, file I/O, and more. The focus was on solving complex problems using Java.

    - Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): This submodule focused on object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, and design patterns. It emphasized building modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

4. Java DB: This module focused on working with databases in a Java environment. Topics covered included database management systems, SQL, relational databases, database design principles, Hibernate (object-relational mapping framework), Spring Data JPA, and MySQL.

5. Java Web: The Java Web module introduced me to web development using Java. It covered topics such as web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller framework), security, RESTful APIs, and more.

## Repository Structure
