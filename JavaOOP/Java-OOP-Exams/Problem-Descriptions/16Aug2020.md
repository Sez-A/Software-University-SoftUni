# **Java OOP Exam – Online Shop**
### **Overview**
In this exam, you need to build an online shop project, which has **peripherals**, **components, and computers**. The project will consist of **model classes** and a **controller class**, which manages the **interaction** between the **peripherals**, **components**, and **computers**.
## 1. **Setup**

- Upload **only the onlineShop** package in every task **except** **Unit Tests**
- **Do not modify the interfaces or their packages**
- Use **strong cohesion** and **loose coupling**
- **Use inheritance and the provided interfaces wherever possible**.
  - This includes **constructors**, **method parameters** and **return types**
- **Do not** violate your **interface** **implementations** by adding **more public methods** in the specific class than the interface has defined
- Make sure you have **no public fields** anywhere

### ` `**Task 1: Structure (50 Points)**

For this task's evaluation, logic, in the methods, isn't included.

You are given interfaces and you have to implement their functionality in the **correct classes**.

There are **4** types of entities in the application: **Product, Component, Peripheral, Computer**.
### **Product**
The **BaseProduct** is a **base class** for **components**, **peripherals** and **computers** and it **should not be able to be instantiated**.
#### **Data**
- **id – int** 
  - cannot be **less** **than or equal to** **0**. In that case, throw **IllegalArgumentException** with message "**Id can not be less or equal than 0.**"
- **manufacturer** – **String** 
  - cannot be **null or whitespace**. In that case, throw **IllegalArgumentException** with message "**Manufacturer can not be empty.**"
- **model** – **String** 
  - cannot be **null or whitespace**. In that case, throw **IllegalArgumentException** with message "**Model can not be empty.**"
- **price – double** 
  - cannot be **less** **than or equal to** **0**. In that case, throw **IllegalArgumentException** with message "**Price can not be less or equal than 0.**"
- **overallPerformance – double** 
  - cannot be **less** **than or equal to** **0**. In that case, throw **IllegalArgumentException** with message "**Overall Performance can not be less or equal than 0.**"
#### **Constructor**
A **product** should take the following values upon initialization:

**(int id, String manufacturer, String model, double price, double overallPerformance)**

Override **toString()** method in the format:

**"Overall Performance: {overall performance}. Price: {price} - {product type}: {manufacturer} {model} (Id: {id})"**
#### **Child Classes**
There are several concrete types of **products**:

- **Component**
- **Peripheral**
- **Computer**
### **Component**
The **BaseComponent** is a derived class from **BaseProduct** and a **base class** for any **components** and it **should not be able to be instantiated**.
#### **Data**
- **generation – int**
#### **Constructor**
A **product** should take the following values upon initialization:

**(int id, String manufacturer, String model, double price, double overallPerformance, int generation)**

Override **toString()** method in the format:

**"Overall Performance: {overall performance}. Price: {price} - {product type}: {manufacturer} {model} (Id: {id}) Generation: {generation}"**
#### **Child Classes**
There are several specific types of **components**, where the **overall performance** has a **different multiplier**:

- **CentralProcessingUnit** - multiplier is **1.25**
- **Motherboard** – multiplier is **1.25**
- **PowerSupply** – multiplier is **1.05**
- **RandomAccessMemory** – multiplier is **1.20**
- **SolidStateDrive** – multiplier is **1.20**
- **VideoCard** – multiplier is **1.15**

**Example**: If we create the **CentralProcessingUnit** with overallPerformance – 50 from the constructor, and multiplier **1.25**, the overallPerformance should be 62.50.
### **Peripheral**
The **BasePeripheral** is a derived class from **BaseProduct** and a **base class** for any **peripherals** and it **should not be able to be instantiated**.
#### **Data**
- **connectionType** – **String**
#### **Constructor**
A **product** should take the following values upon initialization:

**(int id, String manufacturer, String model, double price, double overallPerformance, String connectionType)**

Override **toString()** method in the format:

**"Overall Performance: {overall performance}. Price: {price} - {product type}: {manufacturer} {model} (Id: {id}) Connection Type: {connection type}"**
#### **Child Classes**
There are several concrete types of **peripherals**:

- **Headset**
- **Keyboard**
- **Monitor**
- **Mouse**
### **Computer**
The **BaseComputer** is a derived class from **BaseProduct** and a **base class** for any **computers** and it **should not be able to be instantiated**.
#### **Data**
- **components** – **List**
- **peripherals** – **List**
#### **Constructor**
A **product** should take the following values upon initialization:

**(int id, String manufacturer, String model, double price, double overallPerformance)**

Override **toString()** method in the format:

**"Overall Performance: {overall performance}. Price: {price} - {product type}: {manufacturer} {model} (Id: {id})"**

**" Components ({components count}):"**

**"  {component one}"**

**"  {component two}"**

**"  {component n}"**

**" Peripherals ({peripherals count}); Average Overall Performance ({average overall performance peripherals}):"**

**"  {peripheral one}"**

**"  {peripheral two}"**

**"  {peripheral n}"**

**Note: Be careful, some of the rows have one or two whitespaces at the beginning of the sentences!**
#### **Behavior**
##### **double getOverallPerformance()**
**Override** **the** **base functionality** (if the components collection is empty, it should return only the **computer overall performance**, otherwise return the sum of the **computer overall performance** and the average overall performance from all components)
##### **double getPrice()**
**Override the base functionality** (The price is equal to the **total sum** of the **computer price** with the **sum of all component prices** and the **sum of all peripheral prices**)
##### **void addComponent(Component component)**
If the components collection contains a component with the same component type, throw an **IllegalArgumentException** with the message **"Component {component type} already exists in {computer type} with Id {id}."**

Otherwise add the component in the components collection.
##### **Component removeComponent(String componentType)**
If the components collection is empty or does not have a component of that type, throw an **IllegalArgumentException** with the message **"Component {component type} does not exist in {computer type} with Id {id}."**

Otherwise remove the component of that type and return it.
##### **void аddPeripheral(Peripheral peripheral)**
If the peripherals collection contains a peripheral with the same peripheral type, throw an **IllegalArgumentException** with the message **"Peripheral {peripheral type} already exists in {computer type} with Id {id}."**

Otherwise add the peripheral in peripherals collection.
##### **Peripheral removePeripheral(String peripheralType)**
If the peripherals collection is empty or does not have a peripheral of that type, throw an **IllegalArgumentException** with the message **"Peripheral {peripheral type} does not exist in {computer type} with Id {id}."**

Otherwise remove the peripheral of that type and return it.
#### **Child Classes**
There are several specific types of **computers,** where the **overall performance** has a **different value**:

- **DesktopComputer** – overall performance is **15**
- **Laptop** – overall performance is **10**

Child classes should **not** receive an overall performance as a parameter from the constructor.
### **Task 2: Business Logic (150 Points)**
### **The Controller Class**
The business logic of the program should be concentrated around several **commands**. You are given interfaces, which you have to implement in the correct classes.

**Note: The ControllerImpl class SHOULD NOT handle exceptions! The tests are designed to expect exceptions, not messages!**

The first interface is the **Controller**. You must create a **ControllerImpl** class, which implements the interface and implements all of its methods. The constructor, of the **ControllerImpl**, does not take any arguments. The given methods should have the logic, described for each in the **Commands** section.
### **Commands**
There are several commands, which control the business logic of the application. They are stated below. 

**NOTE:** For each command, except for **"addComputer"** and **"buyBest"**, you must check if a computer, with that id, exists in the computers collection. If it doesn't, throw an **IllegalArgumentException** with the message **"Computer with this id does not exist."**.
#### **addComputer Command**

## 2. **Input / Output**
You are provided with one interface, which will help you with the correct execution process of your program. The interface is **Engine** and the class implementing this interface should read the input and when the program finishes, this class should print the output.

You are given the **EngineImpl** class with written logic in it. In order the code to be **compiled**, some parts are **commented**, **don’t forget to comment them out**. The **try-catch block** is also **commented** in order for the program to **throw exceptions and for you to see them**, **comment it out** when you are **ready** with this too.
### **Input**
Below, you can see the **format** in which **each command** will be given in the input:

- **AddComputer {computer type} {id} {manufacturer} {model} {price}**
- **AddComponent {computer id} {component id} {component type} {manufacturer} {model} {price} {overall performance} {generation}**
- **RemoveComponent {component type} {computer id}**
- **AddPeripheral {computer id} {peripheral id} { peripheral type} {manufacturer} {model} {price} {overall performance} {connection type}**
- **RemovePeripheral {peripheral type} {computer id}**
- **BuyComputer {id}**
- **BuyBestComputer {budget}**
- **GetComputerData {id}**
- **Close**
### **Output**
