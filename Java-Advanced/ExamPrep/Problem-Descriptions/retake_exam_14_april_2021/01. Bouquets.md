*You want to go on a bouquets competition but to participate you have to make at least 5* *bouquets.*

You will be given **two sequences of integers, representing daffodils and tulips.** You need to start making bouquets **knowing that one bouquets needs 15 flowers**. Your goal is to make **at least 5 bouquets.**

You will start crafting from the **last tulips** and the **first daffodils**. If the **sum** of their values is **equal** to **15** – **create one bouquet** and **remove** them. While the sum is **bigger than 15**, keep **decreasing** the value of the **tulips by 2**. If the sum **is less than 15 you have to store them for later and remove them**. You need to **stop** combining when you have **no more daffodils or tulips**. In the end, if you have **any stored flowers you should make as many bouquets as you can with them.** 
### **Input**
- On the **first line**, you will receive the integers representing the **tulips**, **separated** by **", "**.
- On the **second line**, you will receive the integers representing the **daffodils**, **separated** by "**,** ".

|<p>10, 15, 2, 7, 9, 13</p><p>2, 10, 8, 12, 0, 5</p><p></p>|You made it! You go to the competition with 5 bouquets!|
|**Comment**|
|<p>We start with the last tulips (13) and the first daffodils (2) -> 13 + 2 = 15 -> 15 = 15 So we create one bouquet and remove them bouth. </p><p>Next we have 9 + 10 = 19 -> 19 > 15 so we decrease the tulips by 2 -> 7 + 10 = 17 and we decrease the tulips by 2 -> 5 + 10 = 15 and we create one more bouquet and remove them.</p><p>Next, we have 7 + 8 = 15. We create one more bouquet and remove them.</p><p>Next, we have  2 + 12 = 14 -> 14 < 15 so we have to store theire sum for later and remove theme.</p><p>Next, we have 15 + 0 = 15 so we create one more bouquet.</p><p>And last we have 10 + 5 = 15, we create one more bouquet and stop mixing because we don’t have any flowers left.</p><p>Now we have a tottal of 5 bouquets and we also have 14 flowers left but we cant create bouquet because 14 < 15. </p>|

We create 3 more bouquets because 3 \* 15 = 45 -> 50 – 45 = 5 -> 5 < 15.</p>|
