*Each member of your family has a magic box of items and now it\'s your
turn, so you will buy a few.*

Every purchase gives you two magic boxes and they are represented as a
sequence of integers. First, you will be given **a sequence of integers,
representing the first magic box**. Afterwards, you will be given
another **sequence of integers representing the second magic box**.

You need to start from the **first item** in the first box and **sum**
it with the last item in the second box. If the **sum** of their values
is **an even number,** add the **summed** item to **your collection of
claimed items** and **remove** them **both** from the boxes. Otherwise,
remove the last item from the second box and add it at the last position
in the first box. You need to **stop** summing items when one of the
boxes becomes empty.

If the first magic box becomes empty print:

**\"First magic box is empty.\"**

If the second magic box becomes empty print:

**\"Second magic box is empty.\"**

In the end you need to determine the quality of your claimed items. If
the sum of the claimed items is equal to or greater than 90, print:

**\"Wow, your prey was epic! Value: {sum of claimed items}\"**

Else print:

**\"Poor prey\... Value: {sum of claimed items}\"**

### Input

-   On the **first line**, you will receive the integers representing
    the **first magic box**, **separated** by a **single space**.

-   On the **second line**, you will receive the integers representing
    the **second magic box, separated** by a **single space**.

### Output

-   On the **first** line of output -- print which box got empty in the
    format described above.

-   On the **second** line -- the quality of your prey in the format
    described above.

### Constraints

-   All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range **\[0,
    100\]**.

-   There won't be a case where both magic boxes become empty at the
    same time.

+===================+=======================+=======================+
| 10 11 8 13 5 6    | Second magic box is   | First we sum 10 and   |
|                   | empty.                | 3. We get 13, which   |
| 0 4 7 3 6 23 3    |                       | is not an even        |
|                   | Poor prey\... Value:  | number, so we take    |
|                   | 42                    | the last item from    |
|                   |                       | the second box and    |
|                   |                       | move it to last       |
|                   |                       | position in the first |
|                   |                       | box. The current      |
|                   |                       | state of the boxes:   |
|                   |                       |                       |
|                   |                       | 10 11 8 13 5 6 3      |
|                   |                       |                       |
|                   |                       | 0 4 7 3 6 23          |
|                   |                       |                       |
|                   |                       | The next sum is 33 so |
|                   |                       | we do the same again. |
|                   |                       | On the third          |
|                   |                       | iteration the sum is  |
|                   |                       | 16 which is an even   |
|                   |                       | number, so we remove  |
|                   |                       | both of the boxes and |
|                   |                       | we add the value to   |
|                   |                       | our claimed items. We |
|                   |                       | keep summing items    |
|                   |                       | until one of the      |
|                   |                       | boxes becomes empty.  |
