_Each member of your family has a magic box of items and now it&#39;s your turn, so you will buy a few__._

Every purchase gives you two magic boxes and they are represented as a sequence of integers. First, you will be given **a sequence of integers, representing the first magic box**. Afterwards, you will be given another **sequence of integers representing the second magic box**.

You need to start from the **first item** in the first box and **sum** it with the last item in the second box. If the **sum** of their values is **an even number,** add the **summed** item to **your collection of claimed items** and **remove** them **both** from the boxes. Otherwise, remove the last item from the second box and add it at the last position in the first box. You need to **stop** summing items when one of the boxes becomes empty.

If the first magic box becomes empty print:

**&quot;First magic box is empty.&quot;**

If the second magic box becomes empty print:

**&quot;Second magic box is empty.&quot;**

In the end you need to determine the quality of your claimed items. If the sum of the claimed items is equal to or greater than 90, print:

**&quot;Wow, your prey was epic! Value: {sum of claimed items}&quot;**

Else print:

**&quot;Poor prey... Value: {sum of claimed items}&quot;**

### Input

- On the **first line** , you will receive the integers representing the **first magic box** , **separated** by a **single space**.
- On the **second line** , you will receive the integers representing the **second magic box, separated** by a **single space**.

### Output

- On the **first** line of output – print which box got empty in the format described above.
- On the **second** line – the quality of your prey in the format described above.

### Constraints

- All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range **[0, 100]**.
- There won&#39;t be a case where both magic boxes become empty at the same time.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 11 8 13 5 60 4 7 3 6 23 3 | Second magic box is empty.Poor prey... Value: 42 | First we sum 10 and 3. We get 13, which is not an even number, so we take the last item from the second box and move it to last position in the first box. The current state of the boxes: 10 11 8 13 5 6 3 0 4 7 3 6 23The next sum is 33 so we do the same again. On the third iteration the sum is 16 which is an even number, so we remove both of the boxes and we add the value to our claimed items. We keep summing items until one of the boxes becomes empty. |
