One of the mission that new agents have to complete is called BombField. Your task is to implement the mission into a simple program.

We get as input **the size** of the **field** in which our sapper moves. The field is **always a square**. After that we receive the commands wich represent the directions in which the sapper should move. The sapper **starts** from                  **s**-position The commands will be: **left/right/up/down.** If the sapper reaches the side edge of the field (left, right,up or down), it **remains on his current possition**. The possible characters that may appear on the screeen are:

- **+** – regular position on the field.
- **e** – end of the route. 
- **B** – bomb
- **s** – the place where the **sapper starts**

Each time when sapper finds a bomb, he deactivates it, and **replace "B" with "+"**. Keep track of the **count of the bombs**. Each time you find a bomb, you have to print the following message: **"You found a bomb!".** If sapper **steps at the end of the route game is over (the program stops)** and you have to print the output as shown in the output section. After executing all of the commands there are only 2 possible outcomes (there are not going to be more cases):

- if you found all bombs – you win and the game ends
- if you reach the end point ("e"), you have to stop

Print the corresponding output depending on the case.
## **Input**
- **Field size** – an integer number.
- **Commands to move** the sapper – an array of strings separated by **","**.
- **The field: some of the following characters (+, e, B, s),** separated by whitespace (" ");
## **Output**
- There are three types of output:
  - If all of the bombs have cleared print the following output: "**Congratulations! You found all bombs!**"
  - If you reached the end, you have to stop moving and print the following line: **"END! {bombs left} bombs left on the field"**
  - If there are no more commands and none of the above cases happens, you have to print the following message: **"{bombs left} bombs left on the field. Sapper position: ({row},{col})"**
## **Constraints**
- The **input numbers** will be a 32-bit integer in the range [0 … 2 147 483 647].
- Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
- Allowed memory: 16 MB.
## **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|**Comments**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|<p>**5**</p><p>**up,right,right,up,right**</p><p>+ + + B +</p><p>+ + + e +</p><p>+ + B + +</p><p>s + + B +</p><p>+ + B + +</p>|<p>You found a bomb!</p><p>END! 3 bombs left on the field</p>|After executing all of the commands,sapper move to the **end point.**But there are some boms left, so we print the information.|
|<p>**4**</p><p>**up,right,right,right,down**</p><p>+ + + e</p><p>+ + B +</p><p>+ s + B</p><p>+ + + +</p>|<p>You found a bomb!</p><p>You found a bomb!</p><p>Congratulations! You found all bombs!</p>|The sapper reached the **end of the field**, so he remains hes position and we print the message. After all the bombs are found, we should stop the program and print the appropriate message.|
