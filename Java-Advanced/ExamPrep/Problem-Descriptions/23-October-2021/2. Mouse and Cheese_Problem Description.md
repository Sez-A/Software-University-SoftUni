You will be given an integer **n** for the **size** of the mouse territory with a **square** shape. On the next **n** lines, you will receive the **rows** of the territory. The mouse will be placed in a **random position**, marked with the letter '**M**'. On random positions, there will be cheese, marked with **'c'**. There may also be a **bonus** on the territory. There will always be only one bonus. It will be **marked** with the **letter** - '**B**'. **All of the empty positions** will be marked with **'-'**.

Each turn, you will be given a **command** for the **mouse’s movement**.

The commands will be: "**up**", "**down**", "**left**", "**right**", "**end**".

If the mouse **moves** to **cheese**, it eats the cheese and increases the cheese it has eaten by one.

If it goes to a **bonus**, the mouse gets a bonus one move forward and then the bonus **disappears**. If the mouse **goes out** she can't return and the program ends. If the mouse receives "**end**" command the program ends. The mouse needs **at least 5 eaten cheeses**.
### **Input**
- On the first line, you are given the integer **n** – the size of the **square** matrix.
- The **next n lines** hold the values for every **row**.
- On each of the next lines, until you receive "**end**" command,  you will receive a move command.
### **Output**
- On the first line:
  - If the mouse goes out of its territory print: **"Where is the mouse?"**.
- On the second line:
  - ` `If the mouse couldn’t eat enough cheeses print: **"The mouse couldn't eat the cheeses, she needed {needed} cheeses more."**.
  - If the mouse has successfully eaten enough cheeses print: **"Great job, the mouse is fed {eaten cheeses} cheeses!"**.
- At the end print the matrix.
### **Constraints**
- The size of the **square** matrix will be between **[2…10]**.
- There will always be only one bonus, marked with '**B**.
- The mouse position will be marked with '**M**'.
- There won't be a case where a bonus moves the mouse out of its territory.
