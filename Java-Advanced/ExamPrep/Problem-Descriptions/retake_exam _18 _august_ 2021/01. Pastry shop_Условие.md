*You are asked to cook pastries and cakes for the near pastry shop, because your recipes are so great. You need to mix liquids with ingredients to cook the required delicacies.*

First, you will be given **a sequence of integers, representing liquids**. Afterwards, you will be given another **sequence of integers representing ingredients**.

You need to start from the **first liquid** and try to mix it with the **last ingredient.** If the **sum** of their values is **equal** to **any of the items in the table below** – **cook the food corresponding** to the **value** and **remove** **both** the **liquid** and the **ingredient**. Otherwise, **remove only the liquid** and **increase** the **value** of the **ingredient by 3**. You need to **stop** combining when you have **no more liquids** or **ingredients**.


|**Food**|**Value needed**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Biscuit|25|
|Cake|50|
|Pastry|75|
|Pie|100|

### **Input**
- On the **first line**, you will receive the integers representing the **liquids**, **separated** by a **single space**. 
- On the **second line**, you will receive the integers representing the **ingredients**, **separated** by a **single space**.
### **Output**
- On the **first** line of output print one of the following ouputs:
  - "**Great! You succeeded in cooking all the food!**" -if you have at least

**one of each** of the **foods**, after completing combining.

- "**What a pity! You didn't have enough materials to cook everything.**" – if you **did not** collect **one of each** of the **foods**, after completing combining.
- On the **second** line - print all liquids you have left:
  - If there are no liquids: "**Liquids left: none**"
  - If there are liquids: "**Liquids left: {liquid1}, {liquid2}, {liquid3},** **(…)**"
- On the **third** line - print all physical materials you have left:
  - If there are no items: "**Ingredients** **left: none**"
  - If there are items: "**Ingredients** **left: {ingredient}, {ingredient}, {ingredient},** **(…)"**
- Then**,** you need to print **all** Advanced** Materials and the **amount you have of them**, ordered:
  - **"Biscuit: {amount}"**
  - **"Cake: {amount}"**
  - **"Pie: {amount}"**
  - **"Pastry: {amount}"**
### **Constraints**
- All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range **[0, 100]**.
- Advanced materials **can be** crafted more than once.
### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|**Comment**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|<p>1 25 50 50</p><p>50 25 25 24</p>|<p>Great! You succeeded in cooking all the food!</p><p>Liquids left: none</p><p>Ingredients left: none</p><p>Biscuit: 1</p><p>Cake: 1</p><p>Pie: 1</p><p>Pastry: 1</p>|The first pair is the **first liquid** with value of 1 and the **last ingredient** of value 24, their **sum** is 25, so we **cook** Biscuit. Then we have **sum** of 50, we **cook** Cake. After that we have **sum** of 75, we **cook** Pastry. Next we have **sum** of 100, so we **craft** Pie. We have **no left liquids and/or ingredients**, so we **stop** trying to cook foods, but we **have enough** of them to **give them to the pastry shop.**|
