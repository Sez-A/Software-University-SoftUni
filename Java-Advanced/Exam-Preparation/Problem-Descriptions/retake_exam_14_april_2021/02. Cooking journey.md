*You successfully started your cooking journey, so now you need to sell the products from your basket in the pastry shop* *in order to collect your price.*

You will be given an integer **n** for the **size** of the pastry shop with **square** shape. On the next **n** lines, you will receive the **rows** of the pastry shop. You will be placed on a **random position**, marked with the letter '**S**'. On random positions there will be clients, marked with a **single digit**. There **may** also be **pillars**. Their **count** will be either **0** or **2** and they are **marked** with the **letter** - '**P**'. **All of the empty positions** will be marked with **'-'**.

Each turn, you will be given **commands** for the **your movement**. Move commands will be: "**up**", "**down**", "**left**", "**right**". If you **move** to a **client**, you **collects** **the price** **equal** to the **digit** **there** and the client **disappears**. If you move to a **pillar**, you move on the **position** of the **other pillar** and then **both** pillars **disappear**. If you **go** **out** of the pastry shop, you **disappear** from the pastry shop and you are out of there. You need **at least** **50 dollars** to rent your own Pastry shop.

When **you are out of the pastry shop** **or you collect enough money,** the program **ends**.
### **Input**
- On the first line, you are given the integer **n** – the size of the **square** matrix.
- The **next n lines** holds the values for every **row**.
- On each of the next lines you will get a move command.
### **Output**
- On the first line:
  - If the player goes to the void, print: "**Bad news! You are out of the pastry shop.**"
  - If the player collects enough star power, print: "**Good news! You succeeded in collecting enough money!**"
- On the second line print all star power collected: "**Money: {money}**"
- In the end print the matrix.
### **Constraints**
- The size of the **square** matrix will be between **[2…10].**
- There will **always** be **0** or **2** pillars, marked with the **letter** - '**P**'.
- Your position will be marked with '**S**'.
- You will **always** go out of the pastry shop or collect enough money.
