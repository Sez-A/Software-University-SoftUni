## **Problem 3. Heroes of Code and Logic VII**
*You got your hands on the most recent update on the best MMORPG of all time – Heroes of Code and Logic. You want to play it all day long! So cancel all other arrangements and create your party!*

On the first line of the standard input you will receive an integer **n** – the number of heroes that you can choose for your party. On the next **n** lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their **hit points** and **mana points** separated by empty space in the following format: 

**{hero name} {HP} {MP}** 

- where **HP** stands for hit points and **MP** for mana points
- a hero can have a **maximum** of **100 HP** and **200 MP**

After you have successfully picked your heroes, you can start playing the game.  You will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by **" – ",** until the **"End"** command is given. 

There are several actions that can be performed by the heroes:

**CastSpell – {hero name} – {MP needed} – {spell name}** 

- If the hero has the required MP, he casts the spell, thus reducing his MP. Print this message: 
  - "**{hero name} has successfully cast {spell name} and now has {mana points left} MP!**"
- If the hero is unable to cast the spell print:
  - "**{hero name} does not have enough MP to cast {spell name}!**"

**TakeDamage – {hero name} – {damage} – {attacker}**

- Reduce the hero HP by the given damage amount. If the hero is still alive (his HP is greater than 0) print:
  - **"{hero name} was hit for {damage} HP by {attacker} and now has {current HP} HP left!"**
- If the hero has died, remove him from your party and print:
  - **"{hero name} has been killed by {attacker}!"**

**Recharge – {hero name} – {amount}**

- The hero increases his MP. If a command is given that would bring the MP of the hero above the **maximum value** (**200)**, MP is increased to **200**. (the MP can’t go over the maximum value).
- ` `Print the following message:
  - **"{hero name} recharged for {amount recovered} MP!"**

**Heal – {hero name} – {amount}**

- The hero increases his HP. If a command is given that would bring the HP of the hero above the **maximum value (100)**, HP is increased to **100** (the HP can’t go over the maximum value).
- ` `Print the following message:
  - **"{hero name} healed for {amount recovered} HP!"**
### **Input**
- On the first line of the standard input you will receive an integer **n**
- On the next **n** lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their **hit points** and **mana points** separated by empty space in the following format
- You will be receiving different **commands**, each on a new line, separated by **" – ",** until the **"End"** command is given
### **Output**
- Print all members of your party who are **still alive**, sorted by their **HP in descending order**, then by their **name in ascending order**, in the following format (their HP/MP need to be indented 2 spaces):

"**{hero name}**

` 	 `**HP: {current HP}**

` `**MP: {current MP}**

` `**...**"
### **Constraints**
- The starting HP/MP of the heroes will be valid, 32-bit integers, will never be negative or exceed the respective limits.
- The HP/MP amounts in the commands will never be negative.
- The hero names in the commands will always be valid members of your party. No need to check that explicitly
