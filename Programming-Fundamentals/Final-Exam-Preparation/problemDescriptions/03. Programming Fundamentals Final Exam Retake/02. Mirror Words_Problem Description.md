## **Problem 2. Mirror words**

*The SoftUni Spelling Bee competition is here. But it`s not like any other Spelling Bee competition out there, it`s different and a lot more fun! You, of course, are a participant and you are eager to show the competition that you are the best, so go ahead, learn the rules and win!*

On the first line of the input you will be given a **text string**. In order to win the competition you have to find all hidden **word pairs**, read them and mark the ones that are **mirror** **images** of each other.

First of all you have to **extract the hidden word pairs**. Hidden word pairs are:

- Surrounded by **"@"** or **"#"** (only one of the two) in the following pattern **#wordOne##wordTwo#** or **@wordOne@@wordTwo@**
- At least **3 characters long each** (**without the surrounding symbols**)
- Made up of **letters** **only**

If the second word, **spelled backwards** is the **same** **as the first word** **and vice versa** (**casing matters**!), then they are a **match** and you have to store them somewhere. **Examples** of mirror words:** 

**#Part##traP# @leveL@@Level@ #sAw##wAs#**

- If you don`t find any valid pairs print: **"No word pairs found!"**
- If you find valid pairs print their count: **"{valid pairs count} word pairs found!"**
- If there are no mirror words print: **"No mirror words!"**
- If there are mirror words print:

**"The mirror words are:**

**{wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, etc…"**
### **Input / Constraints**
- You will recive a string.
### **Output**
- Print the proper output messages in the proper cases as described in the problem description.
- If there are pairs of mirror words, print them in the end, each pair separated by **", "**.
- Each pair of mirror word must be printed with **" <=> "** between the words.
