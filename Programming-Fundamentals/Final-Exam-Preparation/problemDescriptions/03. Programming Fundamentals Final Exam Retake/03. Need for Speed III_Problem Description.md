## **Problem 3. Need for Speed III**

*You have just bought the latest and greatest computer game – Need for Seed III. We know that you can`t wait to start playing. Pick your favorite cars and drive them all you want!*

On the first line of the standard input you will receive an integer **n** – the **number of cars** that you can obtain. On the next **n** lines the **cars themselves** will follow with their **mileage** and **fuel** **available**, separated by **"|"** in the following format:

**{car}|{mileage}|{fuel}**

Then, you will be receiving different **commands**, each on a new line, separated by **" : ",** until the **"Stop"** command is given:

- **Drive : {car} : {distance} : {fuel}** 
  - You need to **drive the given distance** and you will **need the given** fuel to do that. If the car **doesn`t have enough fuel** print:
    "**Not enough fuel to make that ride**"
  - If the car has the required fuel available in the tank, **increase its mileage** with **the given distance**, **decrease its fuel with the given fuel** and **print**: 
    "**{car} driven for {distance} kilometers. {fuel} liters of fuel consumed.**"
  - You like driving new cars only, so if the mileage of a car reaches **100 000** km, remove it from the collection(s). Print:
    "**Time to sell the {car}!**"
- **Refuel : {car} : {fuel}**
  - Refill the tank of your car. 
  - Each tank can hold a **maximum of 75 liters of fuel**, so if the given amount of fuel is more than you can fit in the tank, take only what is required to fill it up. 
  - Print a message in the following format:
    **"{car} refueled with {fuel} liters"**
- **Revert : {car} : {kilometers}**
  - Decrease the **mileage** of the given **car with the given kilometers** and print the kilometers you have decreased it with in the following format:
    **"{car} mileage decreased by {amount reverted} kilometers"**
  - If the mileage becomes **less** **than** **10 000km** **after** it is decreased, **just set it to 10 000km** and 
    **DO NOT print anything.**

Upon receiving the **"Stop"** command you need to print all cars in your possession, sorted by their **mileage in decscending order**, then by their **name in ascending order**, in the following format:
"**{car} -> Mileage: {mileage} kms, Fuel in the tank: {fuel} lt.**"
### **Input/Constraints**
- The **mileage** and **fuel** of the cars will be valid, 32-bit integers and will never be negative.
- The **fuel** and **distance** amounts **in the commands will never be negative**.
- The **car** **names** in the **commands** will always be **valid cars in your possession**.
### **Output**
- All the output messages with the appropriate formats are described in the problem description.
