# **Problem 2. Mu Online**
You have **initial health 100 and initial bitcoins 0**. You will be given **a string, representing the dungeons rooms**. Each room is separated with **'|'** (vertical bar): **"room1|room2|room3…"**

Each room contains **a command** and a **number**, separated by space. The command can be:

- **"potion"**
  - You are healed with the number in the second part. But your health **cannot exceed** your **initial health (100)**.
  - First print: **"You healed for {amount} hp."**. 
  - After that, print your current health: **"Current health: {health} hp."**.
- **"chest"**
  - You've found some bitcoins, the number in the second part.
  - Print: **"You found {amount} bitcoins."**
- In any other case you are facing a monster, you are going to fight. The second part of the room, contains the attack of the monster. You should remove the monster's attack from your health. 
  - If you are not dead (health <= 0) you've slain the monster, and you should print (**"You slayed {monster}."**)
  - If you've died, print **"You died! Killed by {monster}."** and your quest is over. Print the best room you`ve manage to reach: **"Best room: {room}"**.

If you managed to go through all the rooms in the dungeon, print on the next three lines: 

**"You've made it!"**, **"Bitcoins: {bitcoins}"**, **"Health: {health}"**.
