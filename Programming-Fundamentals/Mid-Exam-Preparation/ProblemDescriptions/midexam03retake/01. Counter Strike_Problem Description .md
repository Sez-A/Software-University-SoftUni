## **Problem 1. Counter Strike**
Write a program that **keeps track of every won** battle against an **enemy**. You will receive **initial energy**. Afterwards you will start receiving the **distance** you need to **go to reach an enemy** until the **"End of battle"** command is given, or until you **run out of energy.**

The **energy** you need for reaching an enemy is **equal to the distance you receive**. Each time you reach an enemy, your **energy is reduced.** This is considered a successful battle (**win**). If you don't have **enough energy** to reach an the enemy, print:

**"Not enough energy! Game ends with {count} won battles and {energy} energy"**

and **end the program.**

Every **third won battle** increases **your energy with the value of your current count of won battles**. 

Upon receiving the **"End of battle"** command**,** print the **count of won battles** in the following format:
### **"Won battles: {count}. Energy left: {energy}"** 
### **Input / Constraints**
- On the **first line** you will receive **initial energy** – an **integer [1-10000]**.
- On the **next lines,** you will be receiving **distance** of the enemy – an **integer** **[1-10000]**
### **Output**
- The description contains the proper output messages for each case and the format in which they 
  should be print.
### **Examples**
