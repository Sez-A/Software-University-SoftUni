## **Problem 3. Moving Target**
You are at the shooting gallery again and you need a program that helps you keep track of moving targets. On the first line, you will receive a **sequence of targets with their integer values**, split by a **single space**. Then, you will start receiving **commands for manipulating the targets**, until the **"End"** command. The commands are the following:

- **Shoot {index} {power}**
  - Shoot the target at the index, **if it exists** by **reducing** its **value** by the **given** **power** (**integer value**).A target is considered **shot** when **its value reaches 0**.
  - Remove the target, **if it is shot**.
- **Add {index} {value}**
  - Insert a target with the received value at the received **index, if it exist**. If not, print: **"Invalid placement!"**
- **Strike {index} {radius}**
  - Remove the **target at the given index** and the **ones before and after it depending on the radius, if such exist. If any of the indices in the range is invalid print:**

**"Strike missed!" and skip this command.**

` `**Example:**  **Strike 2 2**

||{radius}|{radius}|{strikeIndex}|{radius}|{radius}|||
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

- **End**
  - Print the sequence with targets in the following format:

**{target1}|{target2}…|{targetn}**
### **Input / Constraints**
- On the **first line** you will receive **the sequence of targets** – **integer values [1-10000]**.
- On the **next lines,** until the **"End"** will be receiving the command described above – **strings**.
- There will never be a case when **"Strike"** command would empty the whole sequence.
### **Output**
- Print the appropriate message in case of **"Strike"** command if necessary.
- In the end, print the sequence of targets in the format described above.
