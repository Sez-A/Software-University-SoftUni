# **03. Numbers**
Write a program to **read a sequence of integers** and find and print the **top 5** numbers that are **greater than the average** value in the sequence, sorted in descending order.
## **Input**
Read from the console a single line holding space separated number.
## **Output**
Print the above described numbers on a single line, space separated. If **less than 5 numbers** hold the above mentioned property, print less than 5 numbers. Print “**No**” if no numbers hold the above property.
## **Constraints**
All input numbers are integers in range [-1 000 000 … 1 000 000]. The count of numbers is in range [1…10 000].
